    <img id="br"src="birdimg.png"alt="bird"width="300" height="400" >
    <p >Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves , characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.</p>

        <p>The African grey parrot’s ability to talk and mimic sounds makes this medium-sized parrot a captivating companion. African grey owners often report that their greys oftentimes talk in context and seem very attuned to their people’s emotions. The African grey parrot is not just a top talker — this bird is also known for its extreme intelligence, which gives them the moniker “The Einsteins of the Bird World.”</p>
        <p>The grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), also known as the Congo grey parrot,
             Congo African grey parrot or African grey parrot, is an Old World parrot in 
             the family Psittacidae. The Timneh parrot (Psittacus timneh) once was identified 
             as a subspecies of the grey parrot, but has since been elevated to a full species.

<p>Amazon parrots are among the more popular medium-sized parrot species, which might have something to do with their gregarious personalities. They are often described as boisterous, playful, and outgoing — some even like to sing. Male Amazons have a reputation for exhibiting “macho” behavior — they might flare their tail feathers, pin their eyes and “strut” across the floor or table top.

</p><p>Amazon parrots are parrots in the genus Amazona. They are medium-sized, short-tailed parrots native to the Americas,
     with their range extending from South America to Mexico and the Caribbean

    <p>The blue-crowned parakeet, blue-crowned conure, or sharp-tailed conure is a small
         green Neotropical parrot with a blue head and pale beak native to large parts of 
         South America, from eastern Colombia in the north to northern Argentina in the south.

<p>Bourke’s parrots have a reputation for being one of the mellower of the parrot bunch in terms of vocalizations and attitude. They tend to be most quiet during the day and active at sunset and dawn. They are often referred to as the “pink parakeet” because of their small size and popular pink color mutation.</p>
<p>Bourke's parrot, also known as the blue-vented parrot, sundown parrot, pink-bellied parrot,
     Bourke's parakeet, Bourke or "Bourkie", is a small parrot found in Australia and the only 
     species in its genus, Neopsephotus. It is approximately 19 cm long and weighs around 45 grams.

    <p>There’s a reason why the cockatiel is one of the most popular companion birds — this slender Australian parrot can be both cuddly and bold. Cockatiels can also be curious and, at times, feisty. With a cockatiel in the house, you are likely to hear a repertoire of chirps and whistles.</p>

        All About Cockatiels - Petopedia
        These little birds have a reputation as a gentle and docile bird. They are very affectionate 
        and often like to be petted and held, though they're not necessarily fond of cuddling. Instead, 
        they simply want to be near their owner and will be very happy to see you. You will also find Cockatiels
         to be playful and active.

            <p>Conures, which vary in size from small to medium, often charm people with their playfulness and inquisitive personalities. They generally like to be where the household activity is, which can include mealtime and hanging out with their favored people.</p>
        <p>Conures are either large parakeets or small parrots found in 
            the Western Hemisphere. They are analogous in size and way of
             life to Afro-Eurasia's rose-ringed parakeets or the Australian parakeets.
              All living conure species live in Central and South America.

    <p>For a dove species, the diamond dove is surprisingly small, but eye catching nevertheless, especially with its prominent red eye ring. Many find its soft cooing a pleasant alternative to a boisterous parrot.</p>
<p>
    Diamond doves are not biters but they also aren't designed to be handled 
    as they are fragile. They are social, though, and need companionship. It's
     just that they aren't a bird that is going to want to cuddle with you.

<p>Doves are ideal for someone who wants a bird, but cannot accommodate the needs of a parrot (noise, one-on-one social interaction). Their interactions are fun to watch and some consider their cooing pleasant.</p>
<p>In English, the smaller species tend to be called "doves" and the larger ones
     "pigeons".[3] However, the distinction is not consistent,[3] and does not 
     exist in most other languages. Historically, the common names for these birds
      involve a great deal of variation among the terms. The bird most commonly 
      referred to as just "pigeon" is the domestic pigeon, which is common in many cities as the feral pigeon.

    <p>Finches are the perfect alternative for those wanting a feathered pet but not prepared to take on the challenges of caring for a parrot. Finches don’t talk and are hands-off birds, but they delight their owners with their aerial antics and social interactions with one another.</p>
    <p>Finches and canaries were used in the UK, US and Canada in the coal mining industry
         to detect carbon monoxide from the eighteenth to twentieth century. This practice ceased in the UK in 1986.

    <p>Goffin’s can also be a bit mischievous and can be quick learners. Don’t be surprised to find that your Goffin’s cockatoo quickly learns to open the cage after seeing you unlatch the lock.</p>
    <p>The Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), also known as Goffin's cockatoo,
         is a species of cockatoo endemic to forests of Yamdena, Larat and Selaru,
          all islands in the Tanimbar Islands archipelago in Indonesia.[4][5][6] It 
          has been introduced to the Kai Islands, Indonesia,[6] Puerto Rico and Singapore.[1] 
          This species was only formally described in 2004,[3] after it was discovered that the 
          previous formal descriptions pertained to individuals of a different cockatoo species, 
          the Ducorps' or Solomons cockatoo (Cacatua ducorpsii).[7] Tanimbar corellas are the smallest of the white cockatoos.

    <p>The Gouldian finch is prized primarily for its gorgeous plumage. This small bird is available in a variety of striking, vibrant colors.</p>
    <p>Gouldian finches are about 125–140 mm long.[9] Gouldian finches' heads may be red, 
        black, or yellow. Formerly considered three different kinds of finches, it is
         now known that these are colour variants of one species that exist in the wild.
         [10] Selective breeding has also developed mutations (blue, yellow and silver 
         instead of a green back) in both body and breast colour.
